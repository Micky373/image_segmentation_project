## Overview

> In this project I have tried to work on image segmentation of more than 1000 ultrasound images.
> The purpose of this project is to do binary image segmentation.

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/Micky373/image_segmentation_project.git
cd image_segmentation

```
## Methodology (Still working on it)

> The first thing I did was to go through the data and find out the image and their coresponding masks
> After I saw the image and masks are of equal sizes and their was no missing image with its mask the next thing I did was to choose the modeling path
> In the modeling path I was having of two methods the deep learning and machine learning path
> While using the Machine learning path I found out that using the RandomForestClassifier works best for such kind of image segmentations
> While using the Deep learning path I found out that the Unet modeling structure works best
> The next thing I did was to choose of the two types, given the fact that I have more than thousand images using the Deep learning path works best
> So I trained a Unet model and resized all the images used the masks as a target
> After finishing the training and prediction the next thing that I tried to do was to find out the losses
> Due to some reasons for now all the validation losses are given a `nan` value
> I am plannig to do the Dice and IOU for my modelling part after fixing this error
